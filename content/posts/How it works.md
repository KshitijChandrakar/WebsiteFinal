Well There are a few domains that you can refer to in order to access the Server
- [My Calibre Server](read.carmeliarose.shop)
- [Jellyfin Media Server](jellyfin.carmeliarose.shop)
- [coder server](code.carmeliarose.shop), [coder server domain 2](coder.carmeliarose.shop) there is a coding cloud server too, however i do not run it very often as VS code tunnels were more efficient.
- [QBittorrent Web Interface](torrents.carmeliarose.shop)
